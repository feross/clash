Feross Todo:

- If pipeline has one or more built-ins and one or more commands, just run the commands
- Support stdin detection (isatty)
- Set home directory manually using getpwnam
- Command lookup cache


Incorrect spec:
 While scanning for the terminating backquote character, no substitutions are performed except that "\`" is replaced with "`"

bash on both versions I tested allows
echo `\\` to be treated as a complete command, even though spec says that first \ will be treated as literal on the first pass (and therefore the second one should be escaped, but isn't)

Moreover, the two versions of bash produce different output in these cases...



"reparsed from scratch" is also a lie
echo `echo '$PATH'` should output the content of variable path if that was true,
instead it outputs $PATH exactly
